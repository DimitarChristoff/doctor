            The list of AMD modules on the right will be passed to our builder, powered by <code>r.js</code> and built automatically.
            Your build will get a small hash that can be used to download the same packaged Epitome release later on.</p>
        <p>
            The builder does not need all dependencies passed, eg. <code>?build=epitome-collection</code> will automatically pull in
            any required modules.
